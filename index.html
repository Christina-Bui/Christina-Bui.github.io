			<p id="about">I'm kind of all over the place. I love to explore
				and try new things. As a student, this means taking an interest in
				a variety of subjects ranging from ancient Greek to planet formation
				to music theory. As a person, this means being open to new experiences,
				especially ones that wouldn't normally be considered positive and
				finding the positivity in them. I'm the only person I know who
				would laugh at getting a flat tire.

			</p>

			<p id="about"> My passion for design stems from this positivity. For a long
				time, the idea of pursuing an artistic career path was very unrealistic, but
				I was adamant in finding a way to make that fantasy reality. Today, I've made
				it so that I can be a designer without anything in my way.</p>

			<p id="about"> When I'm not watching tutorials, you can find me having a hot cup of
				Earl Grey in my room.</p>
