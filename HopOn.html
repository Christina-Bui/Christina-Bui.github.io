	<p class = "projDesc2">"Sharing economy" was the theme of my user interface development course. For our semester-long project, the class was to split up into groups and create a system that facilitated contact between providers and consumers. My professor wanted to keep the problem space broad so they defined a provider as anyone or anything that provided a good or service, and a consumer as anyone or anything that consumed said good or service. After much deliberation, my group decided that our providers would be coffee enthusiasts and our consumers would be people who are coffee-curious. If you like, you can view the detailed notes of the project <a href="Learn-A-Latte Master.pdf" target = "_blank">here</a>. Fair warning, though, there are four sections to the project, each with similar information due to the iterative nature of the project. I found it important to include all of the sections, however, because they show the whole lifespan of the project from its conception to fruition.</p>
