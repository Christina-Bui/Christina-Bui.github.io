The poster contains the whole text of the poem aligned next to an EKG reading of a dying person’s heartbeat. After all, the poem is about the silence of death being compared to the silence of a machine dying. Sound is life. What better way is there to visually depict that than to compare it with the dying moments of a heartbeat?</a></div>

						<div class = "middle">
							<div class = "projecttext"><a>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is another poster inspired by a poem of the same name by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. I was inspired to create this image after reading this unique poem. I felt a sense of adventure and wonder as I read it and decided to make the pivotal moment of the tale the star of the poster. When a sailor shoots an innocent albatross out of the sky, he becomes cursed and must survive his time at sea despite being bombarded with constant horrors. His is turned upside down, almost like the ship in the poster.</a></div>
