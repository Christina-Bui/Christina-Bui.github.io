	<p class = "projDesc2">In one of my classes, we were challenged to create a data visualization using images that my peers had collected over the course of two weeks. Each of us was required to take a single photograph whenever we completely an activity. The activity varied based on the person. Some people took a photo whenever they ate, while others took a photo whenever they walked up the stairs. Afterwards, we were to upload the images to Flickr so that our peers could use the data however they liked.</p>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">Since we were required to use Processing to create the project, I wanted to test out its 3D capabilities. I also wanted to do something playful, so I figured I'd plot the data based on color. I did this by acquiring all of my peerâ€™s images through the Flickr API, importing them to Processing, and running an image analysis algorithm on each image that gave me the average of its R, G, and B values. I used this average value as a single point on the visualization which served to represent each image. The points were then graphed on to the 3D space using their R, G, and B values as the x, y and z coordinates, respectively.</p>
	
	<p class = "projDescEnd2">I then made the visualization interactive by giving the user the ability to explore the data through mouse controls. By doing so, the project was given a fourth dimension: the user.</p>
