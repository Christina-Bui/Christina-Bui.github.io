	<h3 class = "projSection">Introduction</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">With this project, I was to team up with a partner and choose an informational artifact to re-design. Our artifact of choice was a plane ticket not only because it is ubiquitous, but also because of the flexibility of its form. We based our design on the Spirit Airlines ticket.</p>

	<h3 class="projCap">The Spirit Airlines plane ticket.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Researching the Artifact</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic2" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Info.jpg">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Outlining important information sections.</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">We began by doing informal research on plane tickets to figure out what important information we should include in our designs. We noticed that there was some information on the ticket that was not useful to some of the stakeholders involved such as the traveler and the TSA agent. For one, we felt that the original ticket had too much text on it and that its organizational structure was difficult to understand. The TSA agent, being more familiar with the layout of the ticket, may not have as much trouble understanding it compared to a first-time traveler. As I was designing the first drafts, I found myself focusing on the experience of first-time users. I grouped the information so that the different sections related to flight times, locations, and gate and seating could easily be found at a glance.</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">First Attempts</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic2" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 1 Protoypes/r1comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">The first iteration of tickets.</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">There were some issues with these first few versions of the ticket. I was trying too hard to design from an artistic approach and less so from a functional approach. While the information itself and the way it was grouped was not terrible, some of my designs were criticized as being too distracting and had a bad use of color.</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Learning From Our Mistakes</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">In this next iteration of the tickets, I made some attempts at color again, this time after studying some more color theory. I also included some greyscale designs because my partner and I both agreed that it would be more economical. Furthermore, I attempted to make stronger use of gesture and line to guide the user through the ticket. I also used contrasting colors and shapes to distinguish different sections from one another. Contrary to the first iteration, I included information specific to the TSA agents on these designs. Each version has a section dedicated to the TSA Check process.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 2 Prototypes/r2comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">My second attempt.</h3>
		
	<p class = "projDesc3">These tickets were received better than the first ones, though this time, my font choice was criticized for being too authoritative and unapproachable. We were also advised to eliminate color and stick to greyscale instead.</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Trying Again...</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">As advised, my partner and I designed these tickets in greyscale and changed our font choices. Due to the success of one of our previous prototypes, we decided to keep the same information that but change its format.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 3  Prototypes (Refined)/r3comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Some improvement.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">...And Again</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">Close to the end of the project’s timeline, we both agreed to create greyscale tickets both in vertical and horizontal orientations due to the different ways in which people might read. We also adjusted some the fonts that we used, to give the ticket a sense of friendliness and reliability.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic4" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 4 Prototypes (Refined)/Prototype 1.jpg">
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 4 Prototypes (Refined)/Prototype 2.jpg">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Some of the previous iterations were deemed good enough to continue working on.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Finally, a Good One</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">In this last round of tweaking, we lightened the darker values of the successful ticket even more. We also decided that its horizontal orientation was more usable than vertical orientations since it conformed to the way most people read and was conducive of easily finding information at a glance. This final iteration became our submission for the project.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 5 Protoype (Final)/Prototype 1.jpg">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">The final prototype.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">What's Next?</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDescEnd">Since we didn’t conduct any formal user research, we should begin with it if we were to pick up this project again. I would also conduct a competitive analysis to see if redesigning the ticket has any effect on airline productivity.</p>
