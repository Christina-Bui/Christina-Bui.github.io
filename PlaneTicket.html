	<p class = "projDesc3">With this project, I was to team up with a partner and choose an informational artifact to re-design. Our artifact of choice was a plane ticket because not only is it a ubiquitous artifact worthy of improvement due to its widespread use but also because we felt that its form gave us a kind of flexibility that other artifacts such as receipts or nutritional labels could not. We modeled our designed based off the Spirit Airlines ticket since it was the only brand of ticket that we found a physical copy of.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Spirit Boarding Pass.png">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">As a side note, the project required that my partner and I collaborate on design ideas and that we were to critique each other’s design before presenting them to the class, but we were still expected to create our own original designs; therefore, the following designs were created by myself.</p>
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">01. research and draft one</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Info.jpg">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">We began by doing research on plane tickets to figure out what important information we should in our designs. We noticed that there was some information on the ticket that was not useful to the different stakeholders involved such as the traveler and the TSA agent. For one, we felt as if the original ticket had too much text on it and it was difficult to know the organizational structure behind the grouping of the different information that was on it. The TSA agent, being more familiar with the way the layout of the ticket, may not have as much trouble understanding it compared to a traveler who may or may not be travelling for the first time and confused about what’s on their ticket. As I was designing the first drafts, I found myself focusing on the experience of the traveler. I imaged myself in their shoes and designed so that all of the information that I thought would be most important to them would be prominently featured. I also tried to group the information so that the different sections related to flight times, locations, and gate and seating could easily be found at a glance.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Prototype 3.jpg">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">However, there were some issues with these first few versions of the ticket. I was trying too hard to design from an artistic approach and less so from a functional approach. While the information itself and the way it was grouped was not terrible, some of my designs were criticized as being too distracting and had bad use of color. My partner and I both agreed that we needed to go back to the drawing board.</p>
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">02. draft two</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 2 Prototypes/Prototype 2.jpg">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">In this next iteration of the tickets, I made some attempts at color again, this time after studying some more color theory. I also included some greyscale designs because my partner and I both agreed that it would be more economical and more likely that an airline company would print ticket in greyscale rather than in color. Furthermore, I attempted to make stronger use of gesture and line to guide the user through the ticket. I also used contrasting colors and shapes to distinguish certain informational sections from one another for ease of use. Contrary to the first iteration, I included information specific to the TSA agents on these designs. Each version of them as a section dedicated to the TSA Check process. Additionally, my partner had the brilliant idea of designing a ticket wristband as a means of designing for children or for people in a rush to prevent the loss of the ticket. I was inspired by her idea and out of that came the horizontal ticket with the circle motif.</p>

	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 2 Prototypes/Prototype 3.jpg">
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 2 Prototypes/Prototype 4.jpg">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">These tickets were received better than the first ones, though this time, my font choice was criticized for being too authoritative and unapproachable. We were also advised to eliminate color and stick to greyscale instead. However, one ticket in particular received praise for its thoughtful organization and clarity. We continued using this particular design in the next few iterations of the project.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 2 Prototypes/Prototype 1.jpg">
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">03. draft three</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">As advised, my partner and I designed these tickets in greyscale and changed our font choices. Due to the success of one of our previous prototypes, we decided to keep the same information that that one used but place it in a different way.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 3  Prototypes (Refined)/Prototype 1.jpg">
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 3  Prototypes (Refined)/Prototype 2.jpg">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">We also decided to keep the look of the successful ticket, but converted it to greyscale.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 3  Prototypes (Refined)/Prototype 33.jpg">
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">04. draft four</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">Getting closer to the end of the project’s timeline, we both agreed to create greyscale tickets both in vertical and horizontal orientations due to the different ways in which people might read. Of course, we utilized the design of the successful ticket again, but lightened its dark values (something we did for all of our tickets) since it was still too dark and would waste too much ink. We also adjusted some the fonts that we used to give the ticket a sense of friendliness and reliability.</p>

	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Plane Ticket/Round 4 Prototypes (Refined)/Prototype 2.jpg">
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">05. final draft</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">In this last round of tweaking, we lightened the darker values of the successful ticket even more. We also decided that its horizontal orientation was superior to tickets with vertical orientations since it conformed to the way most people read and was conducive of easily finding information at a glance. This final iteration became the end product of the whole project.</p>
