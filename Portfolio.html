	<h3 class = "projSection">Introduction</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">It wasn't easy trying to design and develop my own portfolio. But along the way, I learned a lot about web dev, web design, writing web copy, and most importantly, how many hours I can stay up per cup of tea I drank.</p>
	

	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Finding Inspiration</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">I started by looking at other online portfolios and taking note of any trends I noticed. I saw that some people had a landing page with a short blurb introducing themselves followed by a grid of their work underneath. I thought that this style of homepage was straightforward, easy to navigate, and visually appealing so I went with it.</p>

	<h3 class = "projSection">All Over the Place</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">My first attempts at creating a brand were exploratory. I did not have a good understanding of color theory or font pairings, but I tried to make something that spoke to me. But it was difficult for me to pinpoint what exactly I wanted to say about myself through my design decisions. However, the more I iterated, the better I got.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v1.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Vers. 1: One of my first attempts at web dev. Ever.</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v2.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Vers. 2: A portfolio template I bought courtesy of <a class = "linku2" href="https://bootstrapious.com/" target = "_blank">Bootstrapious</a>. </h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v3.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Vers. 3: I made this because I still had a strong desire to develop my own portfolio intead of using a pre-built template.</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic7" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v5Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Vers. 4: I started working on a design system to make my portfolio more cohesive.</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic7" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v6-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Vers. 5: Further refinement.</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic7" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v7 Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Vers. 6: Trying something a little more dynamic.</h3>
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">The Sweet Spot</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">After Vers. 6 I felt like I needed just one more iteration to get to where I wanted to be. So I made one more push and re-designed.</p>
