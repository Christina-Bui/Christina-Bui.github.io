	<h3 class = "projSection">Introduction</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">Out of all the project I’ve done, this one is the hardest. Not only did I have to create a personal brand, but I also had to think of a smart way of presenting my work. On top of all that, I also wanted to develop it myself.</p>
	

	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Finding Inspiration</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">I began the project by looking at other online portfolios and taking note of trends. I saw that some people had a landing page with a short blurb introducing themselves followed by a grid of their work underneath. I thought that this style of homepage was straightforward, easy to navigate, and simple enough that I could make myself, so I developed my portfolio that way.</p>

	<h3 class = "projSection">All Over the Place</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">My first attempts at creating a brand were unsuccessful. During this phase of my life, I did not have a good understanding of color theory or font pairings. I chose what I thought looked good at the time. It was difficult for me to pinpoint what exactly I wanted to say about myself through my design decisions.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v1.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">The first version of my portfolio.</h3>
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Giving Up, but Trying Again</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">I was discouraged after my first attempt, so I bought a web template and decided that I would be done with it. However, doing so didn’t sit right with me. I knew I had to go back and try again.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic7" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v2+3 Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">(Left) A portfolio template I bought courtesy of <a class = "linku" href="https://bootstrapious.com/" target = "_blank">Bootstrapious</a>. (Right) My third attempt at developing my own portfolio.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Almost There</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">I still felt like something was lacking. I reasoned that I needed a more cohesive design language and went back to work.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic7" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v5Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Implementing my design language.</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I also included subtle page animations for a smooth UX.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic9" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/animation1.gif">
	
	<img class = "projPic9" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/animation2.gif">
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Another Go</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">While I did like the previous version, I felt that it needed some more refining. I decided to take out all the bells and whistles and just focus on the projects on the landing page while keeping some remnants of the older versions.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic7" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v6-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Version six. Not bad, but a bit rigid.</h3>
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Getting It Right...For Now</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">I recognized that what I currently had was a little stiff and uninviting, so I sat down and created a style guide and some design criteria to guide my work. The goal was to build on what I had done before and to elevate it.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic7" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/v7 Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">The current iteration.</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">For the color palette, I wanted to keep things professional, but playful.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/Color Palette-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Only two colors needed.</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I kept the same idea in mind when selecting the typography. I did this by combining a traditional serif typeface and a softer sans-serif typeface.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/Portfolio/Type-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">And only two typefaces needed.</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">Finally, I adjusted margins, font sizes, and line spacing for a more “open” feel.</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">What's Next?</h3>

	<p class = "projDescEnd">I will undoubtedly look upon my portfolio sometime in the future and hate it. So further refinement and project updates are inevitable. </p>
