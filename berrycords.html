	<p class = "projDesc3">In this project, I was assigned to create a user interface of an A/V system for a fictional company. Since I was unfamiliar with A/V systems, this project was a method of familiarizing myself with system conventions and idiosyncrasies.</p>
	
	<p class = "projDesc5">Since I worked on this interface during an internship, I was told to include specific pages and controls such as the video call page, phone call page, present page, lighting options, and volume options in accordance with the common requirements of interfaces that the company has encountered. In terms of the placement and visual design of these elements, I was allowed to do as I pleased.</p>
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">01. creating a brand</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">The first step I took with this project was the creation of the fictional company. I did this so that I could flesh out a design language that would define its brand. Much of the UI work done at the company that I interned at was created with the same color palettes and logos of the brands that they worked with. I wanted to mimic this process, since I would have to understand how to do so for further projects.</p>
	
	<p class = "projDesc5">I began generating the fictional brand by first finding a name for it. Using a random company name generator led me to the name, “berrycords”, which I thought sounded intriguing and energetic, so I went with it.</p>
	
	<p class = "projDesc5">Afterwards, I selected the color palette, typefaces, and logo that were to define the visual language of the brand. I wanted to use a minimal color palette consisting of a primary color, a dark accent color, and a light accent color/background color in order to draw attention to important elements and avoid overwhelming the user.</p>

	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Color Palette-01.png">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I chose the typefaces with different goals in mind. The typeface used for the logo is called Rimouski; this font in particular looked friendly and approachable, which are characteristics of the brand that I wanted to communicate to the user. On the other hand, the type used for all of the other text that appears on the system is Myriad Pro. Not only is this typeface readable and legible, it also communicates a sense of professionalism that users may expect from a system that facilitates business and professional conferences.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Typefaces-01.png">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">The logo was also an integral part of the system’s overall design. When I hear the name berrycords, I instantly think of berries for obvious reasons. As I was thinking of a possible logo for the fictional company, I wanted to incorporate the shape and gesture of the fruits.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Logo Sketches.jpg">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">After reviewing my sketches, I thought it would be best to go with a simple and direct logo to communicate a sense of honesty.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Splash Screen-01.png">
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">02. designing the system</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Wireframe.png">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I wanted to keep the circle motif of the logo by including it within the system itself. All of the buttons and sliders are also circles to show a continuity of the brand.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Main Screen-01.png">
	
	<img class = "projPic2" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Main Screen - Present Selected-01.png">
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">With this project, I focused on transparency. I wanted to keep all the options available to the user out in the open. I did, however, hide some buttons by putting them in a fly-out navigation bar for organization purposes.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Phone Call - Active-01.png">
	
	<img class = "projPic2" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Video Call - Active-01.png">
	
	<p class = "projDescEnd">To avoid making the UI too cluttered, I made ample use of white space. My goal was to let the UI breathe and to match the openness of the company’s brand. <a class = "linku" href="berrycords Complete.pdf" target = "_blank">Here's</a> a more detailed of the project.</p>
