	<p class = "projDesc">During one of my internships, I was given a task to test my skills in UI design. My assignment was to create an interface for an A/V system for a fictional company using Illustrator. You can view a more detailed version of it <a class = "linku" href="berrycords Complete.pdf" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Splash Screen-01.png">

	<p class = "projDesc">With this project, I focused on transparency. I wanted to keep all the options available to the user out in the open. I did, however, hide some buttons by putting them in a fly-out navigation bar for organization purposes.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Main Screen-01.png">
	
	<img class = "projPic2" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Main Screen - Present Selected-01.png">
	
	<p class = "projDesc">To avoid making the UI too cluttered, I made ample use of white space. My goal was to let the UI breathe and to match the simplicity of the company’s brand.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Phone Call - Active-01.png">
	
	<p class = "projDesc">There were times where I had to include more elements on screen than I was comfortable with to adhere to the standards of an A/V system. Combined with having to stay true to the company’s branding, this proved to be an interesting challenge. I tackled it by placing the buttons in a manner similar to that of the company logo and adding generous padding to each element.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Video Call - Active-01.png">
	
	<p class = "projDescEnd">At the end of this task, I had come out of it with a solid grasp of A/V systems and was confident creating more UI with similar functions. I also believe that I was able to improve by UI design skills in general since I had to adapt to an unknown format. However, since the company’s brand was of my own creation, my growth may have been limited because I was designing in a style that was in my comfort zone. If I were to attempt this project again, I would try adding more functions and designing for an established brand that is vastly different from mine.</p>
