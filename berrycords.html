	<h3 class="projTitleSmall3">A new take on the traditional audio-visual experience.</h3>
	
	<h3 class = "projTitleSmall">UI Design | Branding | Graphic Design</h3>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Introduction</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">During my internship at Diversified, I was tasked with designing the interfaces and experiences of audio-visual conferencing systems. As a means of familiarizing myself with the peculiarities of said systems, I had to to create one for a fictitious company.</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Who is It For?</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">While there was no formal research done on the user population, the design team made an inference that most of the user base consisted of people who are middle to upper class and people who are in their thirties or above. They also assumed that this demographic would not be tech savvy. The design lead suggested that it would be best if I made something that was self-explanatory with big buttons and high contrast.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Personas/CEO Persona.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">A persona depicting a possible member of the user base.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Creating a Brand</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">Using a random company name generator, I came across the name, “berrycords”, which I thought sounded intriguing and energetic. This name set the stage for the rest of my branding and design decisions.</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Visual Design</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I wanted to use a minimal color palette consisting of a primary color, a dark accent color, and a background color to draw attention to important elements and to avoid overwhelming the user.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Color Palette-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">The three colors of berrycords.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Typography</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I used Rimouski on the splash screen because it felt friendly and its round edges went well with the logo. The type used for rest of the text that appears on the system is Myriad Pro for its great readability and professionalism.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Typefaces-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">berrycords typefaces.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Logo</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">The name “berrycords” conjures up mental images of fruit for obvious reasons. As I was thinking of a possible logo for the fictional company, I wanted to incorporate the shape of berries, but in a simplified way.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Logo Sketches.jpg">
	
    <h3 class="projCap">Some logo sketches.</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Splash Screen-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Finalized logo on the system splash page.</h3>
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Designing the System</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I kept the circle motif of the logo by embedding it within the system itself. All the buttons and sliders are also circles for consistency. The standard functionalities of audio-visual conferencing systems are presenting from an external device, video calling, and phone/audio calling, which I have included.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Wireframes/Wireframe Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Some system wireframes.</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Screen Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Finalized versions of the interface.</h3>

	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">What's Next?</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDescEnd5">If I were to continue this project, I would conduct some usability tests to see how my design holds up against others. User research on users of audio-visual systems would also be beneficial due to the insights that can be captured from them.</p>
