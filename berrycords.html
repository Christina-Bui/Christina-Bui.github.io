	<h3 class = "projSection">Introduction</h3>

	<p class = "projDesc3">During my internship at Diversified, I was tasked with designing the interfaces and experiences of audio-visual conferencing systems. My first assignment was to design an A/V system for a fake company to get to know the nuances of this type of interface.</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Who is It For?</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">While there was no formal research done on the user population, the design team made an inference that most of the user base consisted of people who are middle to upper class and people who are in their thirties or above. They also assumed that this demographic would not be tech savvy.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Personas/CEO Persona-01.jpg">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">A persona depicting a possible member of the user base.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Creating a Brand</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">Using a random company name generator, I came across the name, “berrycords”. I thought it was fun and attention-grabbing, so I used it as the name of my company.</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Visual Design</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I wanted to use a minimal color palette consisting of a primary color, a dark accent color, and a background color. This was to draw attention to important elements and to avoid overwhelming the user.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Color Palette-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">The three colors of berrycords.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Typography</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I used Rimouski on the splash screen because it felt friendly and its round edges went well with the logo. The type used for rest of the text that appears on the system is Myriad Pro for its great readability and sense of professionalism.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Typefaces-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">berrycords typefaces.</h3>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Logo</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">The name “berrycords” conjures up mental images of fruit for obvious reasons. I wanted to make a logo that was reminiscent of berries for brand activation.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Logo Sketches.jpg">
	
    <h3 class="projCap">Some logo sketches.</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/berrycords - Splash Screen-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Finalized logo on the system splash page.</h3>
	
	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">Designing the System</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDesc3">I kept the circle motif of the logo by embedding it within the system itself. All the buttons and sliders are also circles.</p>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Wireframes/Wireframe Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Some system wireframes.</h3>
	
	<img class = "projPic3" src="Images/Projects/berrycords/Screen Comp-01.png">
	
	<h3 class="projCap">Finalized versions of the interface and its main functions.</h3>

	
	
	<h3 class = "projSection">What's Next?</h3>
	
	<p class = "projDescEnd5">If I were to continue this project, I would conduct some usability tests to see how my design holds up against that of others. User research on users of audio-visual systems would also be helpful in making better design decisions for target demographics.</p>
